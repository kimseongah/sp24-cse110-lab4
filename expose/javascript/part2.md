1. 3, The variable i is declared as var, so it can be used in the same function. After for loop, the value of i get prices.length, 3.
2. 150, In every for statement, variable discoutedPrice is declared and the value defined at the end is a discounted price of 300 by 0.5.
3. 150, In every for statement, variable finalPrice is assigned to the value rounded to two decimal places.
4. [50, 100, 150], It returns the discounted pirces of [100, 200, 300].
5. an error, The variable i is declared as let, so it can't be used at line 12.
6. an error, The variable discountedPrice is declared as let, so it can't be used at line 13.
7. 150, The variable finalPrice is declared in same block with line 14.
8. [50, 100, 150], It returns the discounted pirces of [100, 200, 300].
9. an error, Variable i cannot be accessible because let is only accessible within the same block.
10. 3, The length of the variable prices is 3.
11. [50, 100, 150], It returns the discounted pirces of [100, 200, 300].

15. The == operator checks for equality of values, but it is lenient with type differences. On the other hand, the === operator checks for equality of both value and type. It does not perform type coercion, so the values being compared must be of the same type as well as the same value to be considered equal.
17. [2,4,6], The numbers [1,2,3] in the array are iterated in for loop, calling the function doSomthing. Then newArr will be [2,4,6].
19. An empty line is printed.
    4 is printed.
    3 is printed (Although a 0 millisecond delay implies immediate execution, it actually executes after the call stack is clear, hence it runs after 4).
    2 is printed (after 1 second delay).
